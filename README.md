# Streamline Labeling

## About

Work-in-progress application that is intended to be used as an aid to those analysing flow-fluid simulations.

## Features

- [ ] User can load a fluid flow simulation file.
- [ ] User can seed streamlines from a plane of a defined orientation and position.
- [ ] Properties are derived for the streamlines for defined buckets along the length of a streamline.
- [ ] Unsupervised clustering is performed on the streamlines.
- [ ] User can hide/show clustered streamlines.
